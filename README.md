The project was originally designed in a group of 4. The final project was developed by three people:
- Valentin Sagl (Project Lead, Programming, FX)
- Stefan Schuh (Programming, AI)
- Benjamin Soura (3D Artist)

## About 
Enlight is an exploration game within complete darkness, where you have to enlight the world again. The world has its own story, but it is uncertain and has to be discovered first. At the beginning you don't know exactly who you are, or why you are here, but you are accompanied by a strange voice, which leads you through the world. One can move and explore freely and get to know more and more about the world and oneself. But beware! Don't get lost in the darkness and don't let the shadows surprise you!  

## Technical Information
This github repository contains a handful of sample images and a demo video which showcases the game. This repository is missing all Unreal assets and internal documentation. 

All Enlight source code is included to give an adequate overview of our project. 

The project is developed mainly using Unreal C++ and the new Niagara particle system. Highlights of this project include: 
- a dynamic fog system that reacts to the players sorroundings 
- a height-based navigation system that is projected onto the skybox and includes actors (i.e. enemies, bases, buff-giving plants)
